          "You are not a productivity robot. You are a cosmic being with feelings.",
          "This tee won’t fix your existential dread — but it’ll confuse your coworkers.",
          "You’re not broken. Earth is repairing.",
          "Meditation... but make it sarcastic.",
          "Where productivity goes to die — peacefully.",
          "Apps that ask you to journal your trauma for coins… hard pass!",
          "Missing these transmissions might actually be your witty escape from the stupid.",
          "See you in the void. Or on your preferred social media platform. Same thing, really.",
